                              <p>On our first day of our educational tour, we visited PAGASA. I learned that PAGASA plays an important role in our lives because they keep an eye on the weather and let us know what to expect. They give us forecasts, warn us about typhoons, and share climate updates. This helps keep us safe, especially with all the typhoons and floods we experience. They use some awesome technology to predict the weather and make sure we're ready for whatever comes our way.</p>
